# Stargate-analysis
Analysis of transcripts of my favorite TV show Stargate: SG-1. The script web scrapes transcrips of all episodes from "http://www.stargate-sg1-solutions.com/wiki/Main_Page" and counts the number of words said by each main character by season. As expected, Teal'c is not very talkative.

On the other hand, Teal'c plays in every episode of the whole TV show except one. That makes him the most occupied character of all.
